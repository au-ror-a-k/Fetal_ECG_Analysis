# Fetal_ECG_Analysis

The essence of this project was to select a database of signals from the https://physionet.org/about/database/ database.
and analyzing it using the available signal analysis methods for this type of signal. 

I chose a database of fetal ECG signals, which I analyzed using SVD, double Savitzky-Goev filter, ICA 
and maternal signal replacement with an isoline. These methods are described in more detail in the file 
Kovalchuk_Abdominal_and_Direct_Fetal_ECG_{Language}.pdf along with the results and sources.
